My various explorations of the [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/) music programming language throughout 2024.
Most of my work with it ultimately culminated in the [Amenbox](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCaZzI9qvxXQ0YPM6-W1K87on4czJEwaO), a softsynth centered around manipulating samples for the purposes of breakbeat.
ChucK, while definitely lacking in some aspects (no generics, limitations of Chugraphs, no module system), is an awesome programming language with some of the most intelligent concurrency I've ever seen; I will definitely pick it up again in the future.
